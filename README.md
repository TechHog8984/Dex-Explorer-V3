# Dex-Explorer-V3

## This is a clone of Dex Explorer V3. It has support for more classes and uses GuiToLua instead of a model.
I made this as a POC demonstrating that I could, in fact, have Dex support more classes.
I came up with the idea for this when I was snooping through Dex, and I found the api.json file and thought I could just add inject classes into it.
## Loadstring:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/TechHog8984/Dex-Explorer-V3/raw/main/dex.lua"))();
```

Please, make an issue if you want a Class (or any feature, for that matter) added.
